# Projectile-Trajectory
A fun little utility to map the trajectory of a projectile.

For this project I wanted to mirror what you might find on an online calculator, its something that you may not need often but when you do it comes in handy. So for this fun project I decided to create a program that would plot the trajectory of a projectile given the users input for velocity and launch angle.
